## Project Description
This project demonstrates debugging an application inside a Docker container using JetBrains Rider, specifically designed for Ubuntu Chiseled environments.

## Initial Issue Description

The issue arose when attempting to debug a .NET application in a Docker container.  
The following error was encountered:

```text
You must install or update .NET to run this application.

App: /app/bin/Debug/net8.0/UbuntuChiseledWorkerService.dll
Architecture: x64
Framework: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.App', version '8.0.0' (x64)
.NET location: /usr/share/dotnet/

No frameworks were found.

## Testing Process
### Scenario 1: Clean WorkerService

This scenario tests the basic functionality of a WorkerService without any additional packages.

| **Dockerfile**                                                                  | **Result**   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0 AS base`                             | Works        |
| `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0-noble-chiseled AS base`              | Works        |
| `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0.7-noble-chiseled-extra-amd64 AS base` | Works        |
| `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS base`                                 | Works        |

### Scenario 2: Adding a Package that Depends on ASP.NET Core

This scenario adds a package that requires ASP.NET Core, for instance, prometheus-net.AspNetCore.

| **Dockerfile**                                                                  | **Result**      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0 AS base`                             | Does not work   |
| `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0-noble-chiseled AS base`              | Does not work   |
| `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0.7-noble-chiseled-extra-amd64 AS base` | Works           |
| `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS base`                                 | Works           |

### Scenario 3: Testing Multi-Stage Builds

This scenario explores the order and naming of stages in multi-stage Dockerfiles.

#### Incorrect Order:
```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0 AS service
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS base
```
- **Result**: Does not work (uses the first stage).

#### Correct Order:
```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS base
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0 AS service
```
- **Result**: Works.

#### No Stage Name for the First Image:
```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS base
```
- **Result**: Does not work (uses the first named stage).

#### Adding a Debug Stage at the Start:
```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0.7-noble-chiseled-extra-amd64 as debug
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0 AS service
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0.7-noble-chiseled-extra-amd64 as publish
```
- **Result**: Works.

## Final Issue Diagnosis

The issue arose from the initial inclusion of a service image based on mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0, which was intended to prepare files for subsequent stages. However, because Rider (the IDE being used) defaults to using the first available named stage, the presence of a package that required ASP.NET Core led to the error.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, you can:

1. **Add a Debug Stage:**  
   Insert an additional debug stage with the necessary image at the beginning of the Dockerfile. Since this stage is not used elsewhere, it will not impact the performance of the final image build.

   Example:
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0.7-noble-chiseled-extra-amd64 as debug
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0 AS service
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0.7-noble-chiseled-extra-amd64 as publish
    ```

2. **Create a Separate Debug Dockerfile:**  
   Alternatively, create a separate `DebugDockerfile` with just the necessary image and specify this Dockerfile in the debugging settings of your IDE.

This approach ensures that the build process is consistent and avoids the issues related to the default stage selection behavior in the IDE.
